<!-- Add your reflection here
- What did you learn about the DOM?
    I learned to think of the DOM to be like a tree of parent and children nodes. As well as how to traverse those nodes and find the specific nodes that I am looking to update.

- What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
    Some useful methods we used included:
      - getElementById: get an HTML element with a specific ID
      - getElementsByClassName: get HTML elements with a specific CLASS
      - getElementsByTagName: get specific HTML elements with a specific tag
