* **Reflection**

This challenge was one of those challenges that seemed to take a lot of time for something that could be quite simple. It is hard to not stop reading into things sometimes when you aren't quite satisfied with the answers you have gotten.

* **What is a wireframe?**

A wireframe is a blueprint of a website that shows the structure and the elements of what that website will look like. Some have more fidelity in terms of actual content, shading than others, it depends on the person creating it.

* **What are the benefits of wireframing?**

Wireframing gives you the opportunity to iterate on the basic layout of your website before you dive into the coding and start putting the site together. It may be much more difficult to iterate on the design once a lot of work has been put in especially when you include the CSS styling.

* **Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

It wasn't really enjoyable, none of the tools I used really seemed to work the way I wanted them to. I am looking for something that scrolls like a website 

* **Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

I just went with my gut on putting the wireframe together. I am sure I will iterate on it over time.

* **What questions did you during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

The one question I had is what tool should I use to help me put the wireframe together. I didn't want to sketch on a piece of paper. I did want a drag and drop style experience that was easily manipulated but also worked like a website where I could scroll as the content went further down the page.

* **Which parts of the challege did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

I think I enjoyed the reading about the different techniques people use and the suggestions offered. I liked thinking about how I wanted the layout to be for my site. Figuring out the programs was the more tedious part.
