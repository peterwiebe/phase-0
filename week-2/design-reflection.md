* *Reflection*
Thinking from a newbie's perspective the concept of design and user experience are an important thing to keep in mind when creating a digital product. For myself, this challenge should have been shorter than what I spent on it. Most of the time was spent figuring out how to use draw.io.

* *What are the 6 Phrases of Web Design?*
The [6 Phrases of Web Design](http://www.idesignstudios.com/blog/web-design/phases-web-design-development-process/#.Vf2Oip1Vikp) as per Slene M. Bowlby are:
1. Information Gathering - Purpose, Goals, Target Audience

3. Design - Look and feel, Target audience
4. Development - HTML, CSS
5. Testing and Delivery - SEO, Forms, Functionality

* *What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?*
My site's primary goal is be an online representation of who I am, what I do, and what I believe in.
It will feature all of my past, present, recommendations, projects, thoughts.

* *What is your targe audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?*
My target audience's interests are finding information about me to get a better understanding of who I am and where I come from. My site will address this by displaying this information in different forms, whether its a blog post, a photo, a link to a project.

* *What is the primary 'action' the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.*
The primary action of my website is for the user to experience my thoughts and works. Whether by watching, by reading, or maybe even hearing.

* *What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?*
The main thing about design and user experience is that they are not [mutually exclusive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusivity). To have a site that is built for the human user, the design could be the most captivating and profound, but if a user does not know how to use it then they will most certainly abandon the site.
User experience is how the user interacts with the object, media, which includes their feelings behind it. In web pages and apps there may be several if not dozens of different portals for them to access these non-tangible things and therefore the user experience changes for each instance. Going further than that, there are many different people of this earth with varying abilities and that in itself will create different experiences, whether they are blind, hard of hearing, confident, inquisitive. All of this means that one design will not fit all.
Design is affected by user experience and incorporates it into its creation. Design on its own is shape, colour, movement, effects. User experience incorporated into design gives design more purpose and focus.

* *What is user experience design and why is it valuable?*
User experience design is valuable because it could make the difference between your site succeeding or failing. If you have a cool idea for a service or product but the average user is frustrated by the process of procuring your offering then you will have lost out on a great opportunity, one that a competitor might take advantage of.

* *Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?*
The part of the challenge that I found tedious was finding a wireframing site that I didn't need to sign up an account for. I just wanted to create without having to go through all of their details and information. The two links provided were not great and I ended up using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io), once I figured out how to use their program it was smooth sailing.
