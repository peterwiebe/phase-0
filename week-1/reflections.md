## 1.1 Think About Time

* Reflection
This challenge was the most difficult challenge will probably be one of the most difficult of all because there is no fixed answer to any of the questions and there is a lot of content that could be gone through on the subjects in this challenge. We all know that time is important, that we should try to be efficient, but life gets in the way sometimes, our minds wander. If we can get ourselves into the zone with the task at hand it helps to power through. I will probably come back to the concepts in this section to make sure that I keep the ideas fresh and at the forefront of my mind.
* Which time management and productivityÂ ideas did you learn about?
Two of the techniques that I have heard or read about before are the Pomodoro Technique and the Time Boxing. The Pomodoro Technique can be a useful tool I think as it keeps you focused on the time that you are using. When we focus on the actual time used we have a better understanding of our efficiency. I use a tool on my MacBook laptop that announces the time every hour so that I don't lose track of where I am in the day in case I get too engrossed in something. It is a bit jarring but I find it has helped me to keep on track.
As for Time Boxing, I have never heard the name of it but I read about the technique being used for one of Google's X Projects - its modular phone. While projects at Google X will take years before anything appears fruitful, if at all, the team that was devising the modular phone had limited itself to a specific date as to when the idea was going to be launched commercially. The intention of this was to make the group accountable for their time and the budget allocated to them, to have a sense of urgency in a work environment that isn't necessarily predicated on urgency. I think this technique is especially a good idea when it comes to the unknown projects that are being worked on. Being the first to figure things out will take a fair bit more time than figuring them out once someone has already gone down that path.
* What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
Time Boxing is setting a specific end time for a project or exercise. Time Boxing stops something from being drawn out as you only have the time allotted to work on what is trying to be accomplished and nothing more. The time spans that can assigned can be large or small. The fundamental rule of Time Boxing though is that you cannot work past the time given and then review the progress once the time is up to determine if the objective was met or if the objective and its time allotted needs to be revised.
* How do you manage your time currently?
I am not very organized when managing my time at present. I keep track of appointments in my calendar but I don't assign a time. Having just been married there were many tasks that had to be done and anything that I was working on I just continued to work on until they were finished. I actually was given a lot of grief about one of the projects that I decided to take on a month before the wedding because it was going to take a fair bit of time but in the end a lot of people helped out so it was completed well in advance of the big day.
* Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
My current strategy works for me but I know I could be more productive and time efficient if I gave myself limits to the things that I do or work on. It isn't efficient because sometimes I will spend way too much time on something when really, I could have been done a while earlier (sometimes my curiousness or competitiveness gets in the way).
* Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
I will do my best to employ the Time Boxing technique by setting specific amounts of time to complete the challenges each week after work and on the weekends. I will also use my own version of the Pomodoro Technique to make sure that I stay focused on the task, not spending overwhelming amounts of time diving too deeply to any given challenge.
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
My plan for Phase 0 time management is to look at the week ahead, see what challenges I have to complete, assign challenges to be completed by certain days, restrict time spent to an hour or two to work each day after work and more on weekends.


## 1.2 The Command Line

* Reflection
One of the things that I have always thought was mysterious was the Terminal or bash. It was literally a black box to me. I knew cd and ls but aside from that I was lost. I am glad to have a basic understanding of more commands. bash is very simple but I can see how it can be very powerful. I will do my best to try to wield this powerful tool.
