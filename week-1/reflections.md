## 1.1 Think About Time

* Reflection
This challenge was the most difficult challenge will probably be one of the most difficult of all because there is no fixed answer to any of the questions and there is a lot of content that could be gone through on the subjects in this challenge. We all know that time is important, that we should try to be efficient, but life gets in the way sometimes, our minds wander. If we can get ourselves into the zone with the task at hand it helps to power through. I will probably come back to the concepts in this section to make sure that I keep the ideas fresh and at the forefront of my mind.

## 1.2 The Command Line

* Reflection
One of the things that I have always thought was mysterious was the Terminal or bash. It was literally a black box to me. I knew cd and ls but aside from that I was lost. I am glad to have a basic understanding of more commands. bash is very simple but I can see how it can be very powerful. I will do my best to try to wield this powerful tool.

## 1.4 Forking and Cloning

* Reflection
Having already taken a software engineering course at university I have had a good introduction into git and github which made this challenge simple. My knowledge of git and github though is not in the category of expert yet though, so I look forward to the more difficult challenges to come.
