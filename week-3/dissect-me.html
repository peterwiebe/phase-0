		<h1>Summary</h1>
		
		<p>
			Welcome to HTML Anatomy 101. In this class, you will do the
			learn how to dissect an HTML page from the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, add a new feature to Sublime Text, and mark up your previous blog posts with semantic HTML tags. So get your gloves on, open your textbook (the HTML docs (Links to an external site.)) and begin!

			<h3>Release 0: Set up</h3>
			<p>
				Before you can get started, you'll need to get setup for the challenge. Decide who is going to drive and who will navigate. Then each of you will need to:
			</p>
			<p>
				Create a feature branch in the phase-0 directory
				Using the command line, navigate to the week-3 directory
				Within that directory, (using the command line) create a blank HTML page called dissect-me.html.
				Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. Create a quick pull request and merge the changes. 
				SUBMIT your link to the dissect-me.html file as soon as you do this. This is how your guide will give you feedback. The URL should be something like: https://github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html (Links to an external site.)
				NOTE: You should decide whether to trade roles in each release or change roles half way through the session. If you decide to switch from release to release, you'll want to share code easily using a collaborative editor (or even a simple google doc).

				<h3>Release 1: Bones</h3>
				<p>
					If a web page is a body, then HTML are the bones. HTML provides the structure and form for your page, and if you see an element outside of the HTML tag, something is probably very wrong.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now that you have the page set up, it's time to build a skeleton. The first driver should open the file in Sublime, type "html" and hit the tab key. Sublime should automatically add a basic HTML skeleton. With your pair, discuss the following:			
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What is an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag?</li>
					<li>What is a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag?</li>
					<li>What information should be in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag?</li>
					<li>What purpose does the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag accomplish?</li>
					<li>What information should live in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag?</li>
				</ul>

<!--
	- Which HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

	The HTML5 tags we used were <main> <section>. <main> seems like one that is used all the time like body. There will always be a main part of the page where the action takes place.

	- How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

	- What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? DO you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
